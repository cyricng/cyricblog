    "text": "With the standard of living rising all over the world and more people moving to cities, buildings are getting taller and taller. In The Atlantic’s “How Skyscrapers Can Save a City”, many benefits of these sky-rise cities were mentioned. Skyscrapers can make cities more affordable and make cities greener, compared to urban sprawl (Glaesar, 2011). As many cities across the U.S. are trying close off roads, improve bike lanes, and create more pedestrian-friendly areas, building skyscrapers can help congregate more people at these locations. An example is New York City, which is one of the cities with the most skyscrapers in the world, recently closed off a busy road on Broadway to create room for pedestrians. My biggest motivation for this project comes from my background growing up in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is the city with the most skyscrapers in the world and coming to the United States shocked me with how few skyscrapers there are. Skyscrapers provide the convenience of linking commercial, retail, and living spaces together. While big cities in the U.S. have skyscrapers, the numbers compared to cities in Asia are still astoundingly low. All across the world, not only do skyscrapers provide retail, office, and living spaces for people, but some have even become attractions known for their height. The increase in skyscrapers can potentially solve problems such as housing inequality occurring in many major U.S. cities such as New York City and San Francisco (Florida, 2016). This project seeks to answer several main questions about skyscrapers and their locations. While this is focused on U.S. cities, the results will still provide an interesting relationship between people and skyscrapers. This project revolves around one main topic, which is how the demographic of U.S. cities corresponds with skyscrapers. Prior studies have looked at the density of skyscrapers within 2km of the downtown area, but not the entire city and other demographic variables (The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat). Using these demographic measures, we can uncover if there is a relationship between both and whether skyscrapers are “going to save the city”."
